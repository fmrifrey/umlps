## PSD dependencies
This repository relies on the following external packages for MATLAB based pulse sequence development:
- [Pulseq](https://github.com/pulseq/pulseq)
- [PulCeq (tv7 branch)](https://github.com/HarmonizedMRI/PulCeq/tree/tv7)
- [toppe (develop branch)](https://github.com/toppeMRI/toppe/tree/develop)
- [MIRT](https://github.com/JeffFessler/MIRT)
- [Orchestra SDK 2.1 for MATLAB](https://weconnect.gehealthcare.com/s/feed/0D53a00008pQ1Q8CAK) (requires GE SDK access)

The packages can be automatically downloaded and updated in the current directory by running `update_psd_packages.m`

## MATLAB recon dependencies
This repository relies on the following external packages for MATLAB based image reconstruction:
- [MIRT](https://github.com/JeffFessler/MIRT)
- [BART](https://github.com/mrirecon/bart)

The packages can be automatically downloaded and updated in the current directory by running `update_recon_packages.m`

## PyTorch recon dependencies
This repository relies on the following external packages for PyTorch based image reconstruction:
- [BART](https://github.com/mrirecon/bart)

Dependencies can be handled using a package manager such as Conda with the .yml file
